# Setting Up a Blog with MDX and Next.js

MDX combines the power of Markdown with the flexibility of React components, making it perfect for technical blogs and documentation sites.

## Project Structure

Our blog follows a clean, organized structure:

```
content/
├── 2024/
│   ├── 1-getting-started-with-nextjs.mdx
│   └── 2-building-with-shadcn-ui.mdx
├── 2025/
│   └── 1-mdx-blog-setup.mdx
```

## Features

### Automatic Content Discovery
The system automatically discovers all MDX files in the content directory and organizes them by year.

### Dynamic Routing
Each blog post gets its own URL based on the filename (minus the order prefix):
- `1-getting-started-with-nextjs.mdx` → `/blog/getting-started-with-nextjs`

### Frontmatter Support
Each MDX file includes metadata in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
---
```

## Benefits of MDX

### 1. Markdown Simplicity
Write content in familiar Markdown syntax.

### 2. React Component Integration
Embed interactive React components directly in your content:

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>
  Click me!
</Button>
```

### 3. Syntax Highlighting
Code blocks get automatic syntax highlighting for better readability.

## Getting Started

1. **Create your content**: Add MDX files to the appropriate year folder
2. **Add frontmatter**: Include title, date, and excerpt
3. **Start writing**: Use Markdown syntax with React components as needed

## Conclusion

This MDX-powered blog system provides the perfect balance of simplicity and power, allowing you to focus on content while maintaining full control over presentation.
