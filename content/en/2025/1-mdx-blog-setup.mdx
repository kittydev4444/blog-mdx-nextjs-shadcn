MDX combines the power of Markdown with the flexibility of React components, making it perfect for technical blogs and documentation sites.

## Adding Images to Your Blog

Our blog now supports images with automatic optimization and responsive design. You can add images in several ways:

### Standard Markdown Images

```markdown
![Alt text](/images/blog/2025/mdx-blog-setup/hero-image.jpg "Optional caption")
```

![Project structure example](/images/blog/2025/mdx-blog-setup/project-structure.svg "Clean project organization")

### Custom Image Component

For more control, use the custom Image component:

```jsx
<Image
  src="/images/blog/2025/mdx-blog-setup/code-example.jpg"
  alt="Code example screenshot"
  width={700}
  height={400}
  caption="Example of MDX code structure"
/>
```

<Image
  src="/images/blog/2025/mdx-blog-setup/code-example.svg"
  alt="MDX code structure example"
  width={600}
  height={350}
  caption="Example MDX file showing frontmatter and content structure"
/>

### Image Organization

Images are organized by year and blog post name:

```tree
public/images/blog/
├── 2024/
│   ├── getting-started-with-nextjs/
│   └── building-with-shadcn-ui/
└── 2025/
    ├── mdx-blog-setup/
    └── solana-fundamentals/
```

## Project Structure

Our blog follows a clean, organized structure:

```tree
content/
├── 2024/
|   ├── 1-getting-started-with-nextjs.mdx
|   └── 2-building-with-shadcn-ui.mdx
└── 2025/
    └── 1-mdx-blog-setup.mdx
```

## Features

### Automatic Content Discovery

The system automatically discovers all MDX files in the content directory and organizes them by year.

### Dynamic Routing

Each blog post gets its own URL based on the filename (minus the order prefix):

- `1-getting-started-with-nextjs.mdx` → `/blog/getting-started-with-nextjs`

### Frontmatter Support

Each MDX file includes metadata in the frontmatter:

```js
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
---
```

## Benefits of MDX

### 1. Markdown Simplicity

Write content in familiar Markdown syntax.

### 2. React Component Integration

Embed interactive React components directly in your content:

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => alert("Hello!")}>Click me!</Button>
```

### 3. Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks get automatic syntax highlighting for better readability.

## Getting Started

1. **Create your content**: Add MDX files to the appropriate year folder
2. **Add frontmatter**: Include title, date, and excerpt
3. **Start writing**: Use Markdown syntax with React components as needed

## Conclusion

This MDX-powered blog system provides the perfect balance of simplicity and power, allowing you to focus on content while maintaining full control over presentation.
